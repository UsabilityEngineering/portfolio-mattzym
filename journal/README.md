# Working the Elevator

Every day between and after classes, I head to the fourth story of the library to study and complete any homework I have due for the week. In order to reach this floor, you may either take the stairs or the elevator. Taking the elevator is my preferred method, so I always find myself on the first floor in the elevator area after classes. In this area, there are three elevators lined up next to each other, with a simple interface to the left of the middle elevator. This interface contains two switches, an up button and a down button, but despite the options being so limited, the interaction created by this interface can be quite confusing.

Walking up to the interface, the first part about it you notice is how the wall sign provides special instructions for the down button: "Push ▼ to recall elevator to the lobby." As there is no basement level, this sign serves to explain to the user that there is nowhere lower to go, and instead of the down button meaning "go downwards," it means "bring the elevator to here." This appears on the surface to be a very **learnable** concept, until additional factors are added in. During this experience, the left and right elevator both had pieces of paper on them, listing them as out of service, complicating the process.

With these factors added in, my **mental model** of how I expected the elevator interface to function when interacted with had changed. Upon pressing the down button, it briefly lights up, indicating that the system registered my request. If the elevator happens to move upwards after pressing the down button, the light turns off, even though the elevator is moving upwards. It feels as if the system "forgets" my request once another action takes place. This creates a moment of uncertainty for myself; did the elevator ignore me or is it just delayed? I then press the up button and the down button simulataneously, indicating that I both want the elevator to be recalled and that I want to move upwards in level. This then confuses me more as I think about it, as in my head I believe pressing both the up and down button mean I want to go up. The **conceptual model** of the system treats the down button as a "hurry up" button and the up button as a "whenever available" button.

The issue is made worse by another layer of ambiguity, the sign states that "the far right elevator doors stay open longer" and then mentions that pressing down will "recall elevator to the lobby." But with three elevators, as well as the only elevator in service being the middle one, it is unclear which elevator I am actually summoning. The instruction assumes prior knowledge of the system that a new user would not have. From a usability standpoint, this situation highlights a problem with **feedback**, which refers to how a system communicates the result of a user's action. When I press the button, I get initial visual feedback with the light turning on, but the feedback is incomplete. The system clearly does not tell me whether an elevator is actually on its way, or which one will be, I just have to expect an elevator will come to me. Once the light turns off, the system gives no confirmation of what happened next.

If I were to make improvements to the system, I would change this singular interface to multiple of the buttons above, assuming that the interface only treats the right elevator as a priority elevator for the down button. This button is the most commonly used and **memorable** device for calling an elevator, as the user knows the elevator will come to their level if they press the button. The up and down buttons on the library elevator interface are redundant, as if you press the up or down button, you still have to choose inside whether you want to go upwards or downwards by choosing a higher or lower floor number. If we wanted to keep the "recall" button, I would add specification to the sign, stating the function for all elevators instead of just the rightmost elevator to prevent confusion.
